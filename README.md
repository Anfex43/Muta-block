This is the repository for Muta-block a final year cyber-security project by Bradley Wilson

Project title: Blockchain and Itâ€™s compliance with GDPR, how do we improve it?

project vision: My vision for this project is to create a blockchain based system built in JavaScript that will allow users, either commercial or personal, to remove their data based on special conditions. This is in an attempt to bring traditional blockchain closer to compliance with GDPR and specifically data deletion requirements. The name for the product is currently Muta-Block. However, this is subject to change. As stated above this blockchain product intends to bring traditional blockchain systems inline with GPDR and cyber security focused regulations as a whole. At the end of this project if everything goes well I hope to have a comprehensive system that can be deployed for use.
